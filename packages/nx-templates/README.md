# @shepherd23/nx-templates

Set of templates for different types of projects fit for our project requirements.

Checkout `src/generators/*` for available templates.

## Usage

See each template's README.md for each template's usage.

## Development

You can generate boilerplate of generator by the following command.

```bash
nx generate @nx/plugin:generator <generator-name>
```

`src/generators/*` includes all the templates. Each template is a boilerplate generator powered by `nx`.

See [Write a simple generator](https://nx.dev/extending-nx/recipes/local-generators) and [Creating files](https://nx.dev/extending-nx/recipes/creating-files) to obtain the sense of how it works.
